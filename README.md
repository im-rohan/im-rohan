## Hi there, I'm Rohan Tanwar ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an ambitious MS AI student at Northeastern University with a strong background in software engineering and deep learning. Skilled in Python, Java, and C++, I have hands-on experience with PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and computer vision libraries.

Before my masterâ€™s, I was a Software Engineer at Precisely, leading projects that improved code efficiency, streamlined CI/CD pipelines, and automated testing. My contributions earned me the Stellar Performer and SPOT Awards for enhancing the UI framework and developing a Component Testing Framework that boosted productivity and quality.

Iâ€™m currently focused on deepening my expertise in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and ML frameworks, and Iâ€™m eager to take on impactful projects that push AI forward.

I thrive in collaborative, high-impact settings and always want to learn, innovate, and contribute to AI.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or discussing potential opportunities.
